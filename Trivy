trivy
sudo snap install trivy

we are going to setup sonarqube through docker and use community branch plugin docker image for scanning multiple branchs
docker
sudo apt  install docker.io
by default not all the users have access to execute docker commands
so give permissions 
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock  this give access to other users also or
sudo usermod -aG docker username
test it by using command docker pull hello-world
community branch plugin sonarqube
mc1arke/sonarqube-with-community-branch-plugin
docker run -d --name sonar -p 9000:9000 mc1arke/sonarqube-with-community-branch-plugin
in pipeline trivy is already installed in vm so you can use command line instead of extinsion and add trivy fs scan command
trivy fs --format table -o trivy-fs-report.html . (dot means scan the current folder)
